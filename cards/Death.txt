               Positive Symbolism: Whilst recognized as Death here, it’s often the case that this Tarot card is left nameless due to the belief that its symbolism cannot be captured in words. In spite of its morbid appearance, the card isn’t just about death and sorrow, but the cycle of endings and new beginnings. In your love life, this can be seen in the end of a relationship and the subsequent re-birth of romance, or professionally, as a change in job.
